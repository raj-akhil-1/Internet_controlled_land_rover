# Internet controlled land rover

Working: In this project, an rover which can be controlled through internet were designed. The idea is that I created an account in arduino clout platform. Through it, the rover can be controlled. when I press the directions arrows, the sytem communicate with the rover through ESP82266 module which is connected through internet. Additionally, when we can also control the orientation of camera through the input which can be fed through the text box in the dashboard. Instead of camera, I used mobile phone to stream the video. Additionally, the esp8266 control the motor driver which is responsible for the movement. The camera movement and other controls were done through a dedicated Arduino. The arduino and the ESP8266 is under constant communication once it's on. while turning left and right the front wheel turn 90 dgree to ease the motion. 
We can improve this model by adding autonomuous movement capabilities which can be done through machine learning.
